* Rover: Use moveForward instead move because this way is more explicit that the Rover will move forward and if in the future we have a moveBackward, will be more easy to add.

* The Rover needs to be in a plateau. Could there are several rovers in the same plateau
* The Rover needs to receive the instructions using a command
* There are a lot of logic in the rover. Try to simplify it.
